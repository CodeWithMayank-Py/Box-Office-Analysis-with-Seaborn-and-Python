# Box Office Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file for analyzing box office data using Python. The analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in movie performance based on box office statistics.

## Dataset
- **Box Office Data**: The dataset includes information about movie titles, release years, budgets, box office gross earnings, genres, ratings, and runtime.

## Analysis
The Jupyter Notebook file (`analysis.ipynb`) provides detailed analysis and visualization of the box office dataset. Some of the key aspects covered in the analysis include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of box office data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and insights.
- Statistical analysis to predict box office success factors.

## How to Use
To replicate or explore the analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open `analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to run the analysis.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

- `movie_title`: Title of the movie.
- `release_year`: Year of release.
- `budget`: Budget of the movie.
- `box_office_gross`: Gross box office earnings.
- `genre`: Genre of the movie.
- `rating`: Rating of the movie.
- `runtime_minutes`: Runtime of the movie in minutes.
